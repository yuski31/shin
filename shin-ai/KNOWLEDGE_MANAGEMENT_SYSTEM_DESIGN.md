# Knowledge Management System (Phase 15.3) - Architecture Design

## Overview
The Knowledge Management System (KMS) for Shin AI Platform provides comprehensive knowledge extraction, semantic search, and learning management capabilities with real-time collaboration features.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Knowledge Extraction Engine
- **Document Mining**: Processes various document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML)
- **Topic Modeling**: Uses NLP techniques to identify and categorize topics
- **Expert Identification**: Network analysis to identify subject matter experts
- **Relationship Mapping**: Creates knowledge graphs linking concepts and entities
- **Insight Generation**: Summarization and key insight extraction
- **Trend Detection**: Time-series analysis for knowledge evolution

#### 2. Semantic Search Engine
- **Natural Language Processing**: Query understanding and intent recognition
- **Contextual Embeddings**: Vector representations for semantic similarity
- **Federated Search**: Cross-source search capabilities
- **Personalized Results**: User modeling and preference-based ranking
- **Query Expansion**: Synonym and related term expansion

#### 3. Learning Management System
- **Skill Gap Analysis**: Competency framework-based assessment
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: Adaptive algorithm-driven content delivery
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive dashboard and analytics
- **Certification Management**: Blockchain-based credential verification
- **Competency Mapping**: Ontology-based skill relationship mapping

### Technology Stack

#### Backend Services
- **Next.js 15** with TypeScript for API layer
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose for document storage
- **Neo4j** for knowledge graph relationships
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **Elasticsearch** for full-text search capabilities
- **Socket.io** for real-time collaboration
- **Kafka** for event streaming and processing

#### AI/ML Integration
- **LangChain** for LLM orchestration
- **OpenAI/Anthropic** for text generation and embeddings
- **Hugging Face** for specialized NLP models
- **NetworkX** for graph analysis and expert identification
- **Scikit-learn** for topic modeling and clustering

#### Frontend Components
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Real-time dashboards** with WebSocket integration
- **Interactive knowledge graphs** with D3.js
- **Collaborative editing** with operational transforms

## Database Schema Design

### Knowledge Graph Schema (Neo4j)
```typescript
// Core entities
(:Document {id, title, content, type, createdAt, updatedAt})
(:Concept {id, name, description, confidence, domain})
(:Expert {id, name, expertise, reputation, availability})
(:Topic {id, name, description, popularity, trend})
(:Insight {id, content, type, confidence, source})

// Relationships
(:Document)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Concept)
(:Concept)-[:RELATED_TO]->(:Concept)
(:Expert)-[:EXPERTISE_IN]->(:Concept)
(:Document)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:Topic)
(:Insight)-[:DERIVED_FROM]->(:Document)
(:Expert)-[:CONTRIBUTED_TO]->(:Insight)
```

### Learning Management Schema (MongoDB)
```typescript
// Core collections
knowledge_content: {
  id: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  content: String,
  type: 'course' | 'module' | 'lesson' | 'assessment',
  difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced',
  prerequisites: [ObjectId],
  competencies: [ObjectId],
  metadata: Object
}

user_learning_paths: {
  userId: ObjectId,
  pathId: ObjectId,
  progress: Number,
  completedItems: [ObjectId],
  currentItem: ObjectId,
  adaptiveRecommendations: [ObjectId]
}

certifications: {
  id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId,
  competencyId: ObjectId,
  issuer: String,
  blockchainHash: String,
  issuedAt: Date,
  expiresAt: Date,
  verificationUrl: String
}
```
